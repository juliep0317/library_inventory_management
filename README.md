# Library Inventory Management Project 
## Create a Python script that manages a library's inventory of books using lambdas, arrays, and simple OOP concepts.

### This project demonstrates the following concepts:

- OOP: The Book and Library classes are defined to represent books and a library, respectively.
- Arrays: The books attribute in the Library class is an array (list) that stores the library's collection of books.
- Lambdas:
- The search_by_title and search_by_author methods use lambdas to search for books based on title and author, respectively.
- The update_availability method uses a lambda to update the availability of a book with a specific title.

  This project was a helpful and practical way to practise the Object-Oriented_Programming concepts, as well as the arrays and lambda concepts.
